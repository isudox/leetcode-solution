"""980. Unique Paths III
https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-iii/

On a 2-dimensional grid, there are 4 types of squares:

  1 represents the starting square.  There is exactly one starting square.
  2 represents the ending square.  There is exactly one ending square.
  0 represents empty squares we can walk over.
  -1 represents obstacles that we cannot walk over.
  Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the
  ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.

Example 1:

Input: [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,-1]]
  Output: 2
  Explanation: We have the following two paths:
  1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)
  2. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2)

Note:

  1 <= grid.length * grid[0].length <= 20
